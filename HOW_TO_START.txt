  Al Anjal – how to start and log in
========================================

TO LOG IN AND GET FULL ACCESS (all features, change password, etc.):

1. Double-click:  Start_App.bat
   (in this folder)

2. Keep the FIRST window open.
   It says "Backend is running" – that window must stay open.

3. When the browser opens, log in with:
   Username:  2297033843
   Password:  BabaMama1

4. You are in with full access. No yellow bars.

----------------------------------------

If you only open the website (e.g. localhost:3000) without running Start_App.bat first:
- You can still log in with 2297033843 / BabaMama1 and see the app,
  but data and some features (e.g. change password) need the backend.
- To get full access: run Start_App.bat, then refresh the page and log in again.
